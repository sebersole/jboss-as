/**
 * Extended lifetime scoped (XPC) entity manager will only be injected into SFSB beans.  At bean invocation time, they
 * will join the active JTA transaction if one is present.  If not active JTA transaction is present,
 * created/deleted/updated/loaded entities will remain associated with the entity manager until it is joined with a
 * transaction (commit will save the changes, rollback will lose them).
 *
 * At injection time, a persistence context will be associated with the SFSB.
 * During a SFSB1 invocation, if a new SFSB2 is created with an XPC referencing the same
 * persistence unit, the new SFSB2 will share the same persistence context from SFSB1.
 * Both SFSB1 + SFSB2 will maintain a reference to the underlying persistence context, such that
 * the underlying persistence context will be kept around until both SFSB1 + SFSB2 are destroyed.
